# The Ripple Effect
Players take on the role of a district architect tasked with building a thriving community. Unlike traditional city builders, every tile placed has an "Area of Effect" (Ripple) that impacts the surrounding environment. From public parks to private jets, players must navigate the complex trade-offs between resident happiness, environmental sustainability, and economic growth.

## ✨ Features
* **Ripple System:** Real-time radius calculations to show how buildings like Schools or Factories affect residents.
* **Interactive Grid:** Drag-and-drop mechanics with hover-previews and invalid-drop animations.
* **Live Stats Engine:** A dynamic balancing system that calculates Happiness, Environment, and Economy based on tile placement and global level modifiers.
* **Progressive Difficulty:** 5 unique levels that introduce new tiles almost every level (Bus Stops, Power Plants, Factories, Golf Courses) which each have different effects.
* **Save & Resume:** Browser cookies to track level unlock progression.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js, Vite
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Styling:** CSS3
